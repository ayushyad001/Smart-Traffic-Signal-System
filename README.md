# Smart Traffic Signal System (Density + Fairness) — HTML/CSS/JS

A modern, animated **4-way intersection** simulation that demonstrates a **Smart Traffic Signal Controller**.  
Built with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no frameworks, runs offline in any browser.

## ✨ Highlights
- **SMART AI mode**: Density-based scheduling + **Fairness** (no lane starvation)
- **FIXED mode**: Round-robin constant green time (for comparison)
- **Animated cars** moving through a 2D intersection
- **Emergency (🚑) preemption**: Instantly prioritizes a lane
- **Pedestrian (🚶) phase**: All-red crossing window
- **Live dashboard**:
  - Queue density bars (per lane)
  - Countdown timer & decision reasoning
  - KPIs: Avg wait, Max wait, Throughput, Green utilization
- **Event logs** + **CSV export** for report/results
